# MyBabyBridge Fertility Care Platform - Developer Handover

## Project Overview

MyBabyBridge is a comprehensive fertility care platform designed to connect patients with providers, track treatment plans, manage appointments, and provide educational resources. The application is built using Next.js 14, React, Material UI, and Supabase for the backend and authentication.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Material UI v5
- **Backend/Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Styling**: Material UI with custom theming
- **API**: REST endpoints with Next.js API routes

## Application Structure

The application follows the Next.js 14 App Router structure with route groups and layouts:

- `src/app/`: Main application code
  - `(auth)/`: Authentication-related pages (login, register)
  - `(dashboard)/`: User dashboard pages
  - `(provider)/`: Provider-specific pages
  - `(admin)/`: Admin portal pages
  - `api/`: API routes
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components
- `src/contexts/`: React context providers
- `src/lib/`: Utility libraries and functions
- `src/styles/`: Global styles and theme configuration
- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `public/`: Static assets

## Authentication Flow

The application uses Supabase for authentication with the following key components:

1. `AuthContext.tsx`: Provides authentication state and methods
2. `middleware.ts`: Handles route protection and redirects
3. Login/register pages: User-facing auth interface

### Authentication Quirks and Issues

- **Critical**: The login redirect requires both router.push() and a fallback to window.location.href for cases where router navigation fails.
- React hooks must be called consistently at the top level of the login component to avoid the "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error.
- The dashboard layout has an authentication check that redirects to login if no user is found.
- Supabase session handling requires careful configuration in the middleware to avoid infinite redirect loops.

## Key Features

1. **User Dashboards**: Patient and provider dashboards with role-specific views
2. **Treatment Plans**: Creation, tracking, and analytics for fertility treatment plans
3. **Appointment Management**: Scheduling, history, and reminders
4. **Secure Messaging**: Communication between patients and providers
5. **Educational Resources**: Curated content for fertility education
6. **Analytics**: Treatment success metrics and insights
7. **Payments**: Integration with payment processing (in development)

## Recent UI/UX Improvements

### Authentication Pages
- **Redesigned Login/Register Pages**: Implemented a new two-column layout with the form on the left and a branded gradient on the right
- **Improved Logo Placement**: Positioned the logo above the login/signup forms for better brand visibility
- **Reduced Login Redirect Timer**: Changed dashboard redirect countdown from 5 to 3 seconds after login
- **Enhanced Form Layout**: Optimized spacing to ensure forms are fully visible without scrolling
- **Visual Consistency**: Created cohesive styling across welcome, login, and registration pages

### Welcome Page
- **Image Integration**: Added family-oriented imagery to the welcome page
- **Brand Consistency**: Implemented theme-colored gradient background with image overlay
- **Testimonial Box**: Added compact testimonial highlighting IVF treatment success stories
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured proper mobile display of all welcome page elements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Loading States**: Added immediate visual feedback during page transitions
- **Navigation Improvements**: Enhanced the speed of menu interactions
- **Prefetching**: Implemented data prefetching for commonly accessed routes
- **Skeleton Loaders**: Added comprehensive skeleton loaders for dashboard components
- **Memoization**: Optimized component rendering with React's useMemo and useCallback

### Profile Features
- **Gravatar Integration**: Added support for Gravatar profile images as a default option
- **Fixed Profile Loading**: Resolved issues with profile page loading and state management
- **Improved Medical History**: Enhanced the display and management of medical information
- **Emergency Contact Management**: Better UI for viewing and editing emergency contacts

## Known Issues and Challenges

1. **Authentication Redirect Issues**: Sometimes there can be issues with redirection after login. The code now includes fallback mechanisms.
2. **API Routes with Cookies**: Some API routes use cookies which causes warnings during build about dynamic server usage.
3. **TypeScript Errors**: Ensure careful type handling when working with Supabase responses.
4. **Data Fetching**: Dashboard pages need proper error handling during data fetching to avoid cascade failures.
5. **Missing Routes**: New pages must be added with both the correct directory structure and authentication handling.
6. **Image Handling**: Ensure proper configuration for Next.js Image component when adding new images.
7. **Session Management**: Occasional session expiration requires additional handling in some edge cases.

## Code Patterns and Best Practices

1. **'use client'** directive must be included at the top of all client-side components
2. **Authentication Checks**: Always check for user authentication before rendering protected content
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and loading states in all data-fetching components
4. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for Supabase and other service credentials
5. **Responsive Design**: Follow Material UI breakpoint patterns for consistent responsive layouts
6. **Asset Management**: Store images in the public/images directory with proper organization
7. **Loading States**: Implement skeleton loaders for better user experience during data fetching

## Development Workflow

1. Run development server: `npm run dev`
2. Build the project: `npm run build`
3. Start production server: `npm run start`
4. The project uses ESLint for code quality: `npm run lint`

## Supabase Schema Overview

The database includes the following main tables:

- `users`: User profiles with role designations
- `treatment_plans`: Fertility treatment plans with provider relationships
- `treatment_milestones`: Progress tracking for treatment plans
- `appointments`: Patient-provider appointments with status tracking
- `notifications`: System notifications for users
- `messages`: Communication between patients and providers
- `education_resources`: Educational content for patients

## Next Steps and Future Work

1. Complete payment integration with Stripe
2. Implement real-time notifications
3. Enhance analytics dashboards for providers
4. Add document upload and management
5. Implement email notifications for important events
6. Create a mobile application using React Native
7. Expand treatment plan tracking features
8. Add more detailed IVF-specific workflow tracking
9. Implement two-factor authentication for enhanced security
10. Create provider-specific dashboards with patient management

## Environment Setup

The project requires the following environment variables in `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-stripe-publishable-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-stripe-webhook-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Deployment

The project is configured for deployment to Vercel with the following considerations:

1. Environment variables must be configured in the Vercel project settings
2. Production builds should pass all type checks and linting
3. The project uses Next.js' Image Optimization and requires proper configuration for production

## Final Notes

This project implements a comprehensive fertility care platform with multiple user roles and complex workflows. The key to successful development is understanding the authentication and data flow patterns throughout the application. Pay special attention to authentication state management and proper error handling during data fetching operations.

The codebase is structured to be maintainable and scalable, with clear separation of concerns between components, contexts, and API routes. Continue following the established patterns when adding new features or modifying existing ones.
