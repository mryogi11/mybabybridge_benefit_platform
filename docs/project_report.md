# Project Status Report: MyBabyBridge Fertility Care Platform

**Report Date:** May 10, 2025 (Generated based on review)

---

## 1. Overall Project Status

**Summary:**
The MyBabyBridge platform is in an active development phase. The core infrastructure using Next.js 15, Supabase (Auth & DB with Drizzle ORM), and Material UI is stable. Recent efforts have focused on implementing and debugging the multi-step Benefit Verification flow, resolving critical database migration issues, and enhancing UI/UX with a global page loader for the patient dashboard. The development server is operational, and key server actions and page compilations are succeeding.

**Current Focus:**
The immediate priorities should be addressing critical pending items such as Stripe webhook integration for robust payment confirmation. Subsequently, focus should shift to completing partially implemented modules (Analytics, Notifications), tackling technical debt (refactoring direct Supabase calls, improving type safety), implementing comprehensive testing, and ensuring UI/UX consistency across all user roles (especially for the page loader).

## 2. Recent Milestones & Key Fixes

*   **Benefit Verification Flow Enhancements:**
    *   Resolved redirect loops and state management issues (e.g., `setSponsoringOrganizationId`).
    *   Corrected Stripe Payment Intent creation failures by ensuring address data persistence (`updateBasicProfile`).
    *   Addressed premature `benefit_status: 'verified'` updates.
    *   Fixed post-payment redirection to `/dashboard` and ensured timely `AuthContext` profile refresh.
*   **Database Migration Stability:**
    *   Systematically resolved numerous errors in `drizzle/0009_illegal_terror.sql` by adding `IF EXISTS` / `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses, making the migration idempotent and reliable.
*   **Stripe Integration Fixes:**
    *   Resolved runtime error by adding `await` to `getServerStripeClient()` in `stripeActions.ts`.
*   **Global Page Loader Implementation (Patient Dashboard):**
    *   Successfully implemented `LoadingContext`, `PageChangeHandler`, and integrated loader UI into the patient dashboard layout, triggered by `Navigation.tsx`.
    *   Resolved associated build errors (`metadata` export) and runtime errors (`usePageLoading` context).
    *   Addressed `useSearchParams()` build errors by wrapping relevant page content in `<React.Suspense>`.
*   **Build & Runtime Stability:**
    *   Achieved successful project builds (`npm run build`).
    *   Development server (`npm run dev`) is stable, serving pages and handling API/server actions correctly.

## 4. Next Steps & Priorities

1.  **CRITICAL: Implement Stripe Webhook Handler:** For robust payment confirmation and accurate `benefit_status` updates.
2.  **Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   Develop E2E tests for Benefit Verification, payment scenarios.
    *   Implement unit/integration tests for critical server actions and components.
3.  **Complete Core Module Functionality:**
    *   **Admin Analytics:** Refactor to use server-side aggregation, remove mock data, fulfill PRD requirements.
    *   **Notifications:** Implement backend triggers and email notification system. Fully implement user preferences.
    *   **Admin - Provider Management:** Properly link new providers to Auth users. Implement advanced features if prioritized.
4.  **Address Technical Debt:**
    *   Refactor remaining client-side Supabase calls to Server Actions (Admin Analytics, Education, Provider Profile/Availability, Admin Provider Mgmt).
    *   Improve Type Safety: Systematically reduce/eliminate `as any`.
    *   Standardize error handling and user feedback.
5.  **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Implement/Verify global page loader for Admin and Provider dashboards.
    *   Ensure consistent loading states and error displays across all modules.
    *   Complete placeholder UIs (e.g., Patient Profile).
6.  **Documentation:**
    *   Correct `docs/CODE_INDEX.MD` for page loader components.
    *   Continuously update all documentation as development progresses.

## 5. Known Issues & Technical Debt Highlights

*   **Missing Stripe Webhooks:** Critical for payment reliability.
*   **Extensive Client-Side Supabase Calls:** Need refactoring to Server Actions for consistency, security, and performance. Areas include Admin Analytics, Education, Provider Profile/Availability, Admin Provider Mgmt.
*   **Widespread `as any` Type Usage:** Poses risks to type safety and requires systematic refactoring.
*   **Incomplete Analytics Module:** Admin analytics are currently very basic and not production-ready.
*   **Pending Notification System:** Backend triggers and email notifications are not yet implemented.
*   **Lack of Automated Testing:** No formal unit, integration, or E2E test suites are in place.
*   **Page Loader Scope:** Global page loader confirmed for Patient dashboard; needs verification/implementation for Admin/Provider roles if navigation differs.
*   **Admin Provider Creation:** TODO for linking new providers to `users` table/Auth.
*   **Placeholder UIs/Functionality:** Several settings pages and profile sections have placeholder UI or incomplete backend logic.
