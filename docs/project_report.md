# Project Status Report: MyBabyBridge Fertility Care Platform

**Report Date:** May 10, 2025 (Generated based on review)

---

## 1. Overall Project Status

**Summary:**
The MyBabyBridge platform is in an active development phase. The core infrastructure using Next.js 15, Supabase (Auth & DB with Drizzle ORM), and Material UI is stable. Recent efforts have focused on implementing and debugging the multi-step Benefit Verification flow, resolving critical database migration issues, and enhancing UI/UX with a global page loader for the patient dashboard. The development server is operational, and key server actions and page compilations are succeeding.

**Current Focus:**
The immediate priorities should be addressing critical pending items such as Stripe webhook integration for robust payment confirmation. Subsequently, focus should shift to completing partially implemented modules (Analytics, Notifications), tackling technical debt (refactoring direct Supabase calls, improving type safety), implementing comprehensive testing, and ensuring UI/UX consistency across all user roles (especially for the page loader).

## 2. Recent Milestones & Key Fixes

*   **Benefit Verification Flow Enhancements:**
    *   Resolved redirect loops and state management issues (e.g., `setSponsoringOrganizationId`).
    *   Corrected Stripe Payment Intent creation failures by ensuring address data persistence (`updateBasicProfile`).
    *   Addressed premature `benefit_status: 'verified'` updates.
    *   Fixed post-payment redirection to `/dashboard` and ensured timely `AuthContext` profile refresh.
*   **Database Migration Stability:**
    *   Systematically resolved numerous errors in `drizzle/0009_illegal_terror.sql` by adding `IF EXISTS` / `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses, making the migration idempotent and reliable.
*   **Stripe Integration Fixes:**
    *   Resolved runtime error by adding `await` to `getServerStripeClient()` in `stripeActions.ts`.
*   **Global Page Loader Implementation (Patient Dashboard):**
    *   Successfully implemented `LoadingContext`, `PageChangeHandler`, and integrated loader UI into the patient dashboard layout, triggered by `Navigation.tsx`.
    *   Resolved associated build errors (`metadata` export) and runtime errors (`usePageLoading` context).
    *   Addressed `useSearchParams()` build errors by wrapping relevant page content in `<React.Suspense>`.
*   **Build & Runtime Stability:**
    *   Achieved successful project builds (`npm run build`).
    *   Development server (`npm run dev`) is stable, serving pages and handling API/server actions correctly.
*   **Collapsible Side Drawers & Consistent UI:**
    *   Implemented collapsible side drawers for Patient, Provider, and Admin dashboards, enhancing user experience on desktop views.
    *   Standardized the UI of the user profile dropdown menu across Patient, Provider, and Admin dashboards for consistency.
    *   Extended the global page loader to be fully functional across Provider and Admin dashboards.
*   **User Settings Pages Enhancements:**
    *   **Patient Settings (`/dashboard/settings`):** Implemented password change functionality. Theme selection is functional. Placeholder UI for Notifications, Language/Region, Accessibility, 2FA, and Profile Visibility has been hidden, with TODOs for future implementation. The "Profile" link has been removed from the patient dashboard side drawer menu, with profile access available through the user avatar dropdown.
    *   **Provider Settings (`/provider/settings`):** Implemented password change functionality and theme selection. Placeholder "Notification Preferences" section and links to "Payment Settings" and "Notifications" have been hidden/removed, with TODOs for future review/implementation.
    *   **Admin Settings (`/admin/admin/settings`):** Implemented password change functionality, profile information editing (first name, last name), and theme selection.

## 4. Next Steps & Priorities

1.  **CRITICAL: Implement Stripe Webhook Handler:** For robust payment confirmation and accurate `benefit_status` updates.
2.  **Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   Develop E2E tests for Benefit Verification, payment scenarios.
    *   Implement unit/integration tests for critical server actions and components.
3.  **Complete Core Module Functionality:**
    *   **Admin Analytics:** Refactor to use server-side aggregation, remove mock data, fulfill PRD requirements.
    *   **Notifications:** Implement backend triggers and email notification system. Fully implement user preferences.
    *   **Admin - Provider Management:** Properly link new providers to Auth users. Implement advanced features if prioritized.
4.  **Address Technical Debt:**
    *   Refactor remaining client-side Supabase calls to Server Actions (Admin Analytics, Education, Provider Profile/Availability, Admin Provider Mgmt).
    *   Improve Type Safety: Systematically reduce/eliminate `as any`.
    *   Standardize error handling and user feedback.
5.  **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Ensure consistent loading states and error displays across all modules.
    *   Complete placeholder UIs (e.g., Patient Profile).
    *   Maintain UI consistency for new features (collapsible drawers, profile menus implemented).
6.  **Documentation:**
    *   Correct `docs/CODE_INDEX.MD` for page loader components.
    *   Continuously update all documentation as development progresses.

## 5. Known Issues & Technical Debt Highlights

*   **Missing Stripe Webhooks:** Critical for payment reliability.
*   **Extensive Client-Side Supabase Calls:** Need refactoring to Server Actions for consistency, security, and performance. Areas include Admin Analytics, Education, Provider Profile/Availability, Admin Provider Mgmt.
*   **Widespread `as any` Type Usage:** Poses risks to type safety and requires systematic refactoring.
*   **Incomplete Analytics Module:** Admin analytics are currently very basic and not production-ready.
*   **Pending Notification System:** Backend triggers and email notifications are not yet implemented.
*   **Lack of Automated Testing:** No formal unit, integration, or E2E test suites are in place.
*   **Admin Provider Creation:** TODO for linking new providers to `users` table/Auth.
*   **Placeholder UIs/Functionality:** Several settings pages (beyond Patient Settings password/theme) and profile sections (e.g., Patient Profile) have placeholder UI or incomplete backend logic. Patient Settings placeholders for Notifications, Language, Accessibility, 2FA, Profile Visibility are currently hidden. Provider Settings placeholders for notifications and payments are also currently hidden.
