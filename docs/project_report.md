# Project Status Report: MyBabyBridge Fertility Care Platform

**Report Date:** 2025-04-12 *(Please update to current date)*

---

## 1. Overall Project Status

**Summary:** The project is actively under development. Key infrastructure components (Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, Supabase integration for Auth & DB, Drizzle ORM, Stripe basics, MUI) are established. Development has focused on implementing core administrative features, with significant progress made on Organization, Benefit Package, and User management.

**Current Focus:** Refining backend APIs, completing frontend administrative UIs, and addressing technical debt (e.g., type generation, code refactoring).

## 2. Completed Work (Recent Milestones)

*   **Admin User Management (CRUD Functionality):** Successfully implemented comprehensive management features for users within the admin panel (`/admin/users`).
    *   **Backend API (`/api/admin/users/[userId]`):**
        *   Created `PUT` endpoint handler in `route.ts` for updating user details (first name, last name, role) based on validated data from the request body (`UpdateUserSchema`).
        *   Created `DELETE` endpoint handler in `route.ts` for removing users.
            *   Ensured deletion occurs in the primary `public.users` database table using Drizzle ORM (`db.delete`).
            *   Implemented a crucial post-deletion verification step using a `db.select` query to confirm removal, mitigating issues where Drizzle's `.returning()` gave misleading results.
            *   Integrated user removal from the Supabase Authentication system (`supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser`) to maintain consistency between the database and authentication records, preventing users from reappearing after sync.
        *   Resolved multiple persistent build failures by systematically debugging import paths, verifying `tsconfig.json` aliases, checking file existence (`list_dir`, `file_search`), and correcting paths to use `@/lib/db`, `@/lib/supabase/client` (initially), and `@/types/supabase`.
        *   Established and integrated the correct server-side Supabase client configuration in `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` (using `createSupabaseRouteHandlerClient` with `@supabase/ssr`) and updated the API route to use it, replacing the incorrect browser client.
    *   **Frontend UI (`/admin/users/page.tsx`):**
        *   Enhanced the user list MUI `DataGrid` to include action menus (`Menu`, `MenuItem`, `IconButton`) for editing and deleting individual users.
        *   Implemented the `EditUserDialog` component, allowing administrators to modify user details via a form, including state management (`useState`, `useEffect`) and submission logic calling the `PUT` API endpoint via `fetch`.
        *   Implemented the `DeleteConfirmationDialog` component to prevent accidental deletions, triggering the `handleConfirmDelete` function which calls the `DELETE` API endpoint via `fetch`.
        *   Debugged and resolved React state management issues where `selectedUserId` was being cleared prematurely by removing incorrect `handleMenuClose` calls from action handlers (`handleEditClick`, `handleDeleteClick`).
        *   Addressed UI update problems after successful deletion (where the user visually remained) by switching from data refetching (`fetchUsers`) to immediate client-side state manipulation (`setUsers(users.filter(...))`) for a responsive user experience.
        *   Identified and fixed the root cause of deleted users reappearing on page refresh by ensuring the `DELETE` API also removed users from Supabase Auth, thus preventing the `sync-users` process from re-adding them during the `fetchUsers` call.
        *   Resolved transient MUI errors related to `anchorEl` becoming invalid after data refresh by explicitly clearing the menu anchor state (`setAnchorEl(null)`) before updating the user list state.
    *   **Documentation:** Updated the main `docs/README.md` to accurately reflect the new user management features and associated API endpoints.
*   **(Note:** Admin CRUD functionality for Benefit Packages was also previously completed and tested.)

## 4. Next Steps & Priorities

1.  **Generate/Verify Supabase Database Types:**
    *   Run Supabase CLI command (`npx supabase gen types ...`) to create/update `src/types/supabase.ts`.
    *   Update type imports in `server.ts`, `client.ts`, and API routes, removing the `any` placeholder.
2.  **Refactor/Verify `authorizeAdmin` Helper:**
    *   Review usage of Supabase client within the helper to ensure correct context (server vs. client).
3.  **Complete Admin Packages UI:**
    *   Implement Add, Edit, and Delete modals/dialogs on the `/admin/packages` page.
    *   Connect UI actions to the corresponding API endpoints.
4.  **Complete Admin Organizations UI:**
    *   Implement Add, Edit, and Delete functionality on the `/admin/organizations` page.
    *   Connect UI actions to the corresponding API endpoints.
5.  **End-to-End Testing:** Perform comprehensive testing of all completed Admin CRUD flows.
6.  **Prioritize Other Features:** Review and prioritize development for remaining application features (Dashboards, Payments, etc.).

## 5. Known Issues & Technical Debt

*   **Hardcoded `any` Type:** The `Database` type is currently `any` in `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` (Blocked by *Next Step 1*).
*   **API Route Parameter Warning:** A non-fatal warning regarding awaiting `params.userId` persists in the user API route logs. While functionality appears unaffected, this could be investigated further for potential Next.js version compatibility issues or edge cases.
*   **UI Error Handling:** Review and potentially enhance user feedback and error handling mechanisms within the Admin UI components during API interactions.
